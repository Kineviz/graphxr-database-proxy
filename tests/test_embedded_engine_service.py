"""
Choosing a release, fetching it once, and learning from what happened.

Installs and engine processes are stubbed here -- they have their own tests, and a
real one would put a 60MB download in the acceptance gate. What is under test is
the decision-making around them: which release is tried, how often it is fetched,
and what the map is told afterwards.
