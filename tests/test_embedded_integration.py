"""
The whole path against a real engine, opt-in.

Skipped unless ``GRAPHXR_PROXY_ENGINE_TESTS=1``, because it downloads an engine
build -- tens of megabytes, and an interpreter with it the first time -- and the
acceptance gate has to stay offline and quick. Everything it covers is covered by
the stubbed tests too; what it adds is the one thing a stub cannot prove, which is
that the real engine parses the statements and answers in the shape the mapper
expects.

Run it with::

    GRAPHXR_PROXY_ENGINE_TESTS=1 uv run pytest tests/test_embedded_integration.py -q

``GRAPHXR_PROXY_ENGINES_DIR`` is worth setting to a scratch directory the first
time, so the downloads do not land in the developer's home.
