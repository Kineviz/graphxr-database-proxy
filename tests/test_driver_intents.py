"""
Every shipped driver carries a capability record and a dialect, so the GraphXR
client can use intent mode instead of building statements itself.

The point of the parametrised cases is that adding a driver cannot quietly skip
this: a new backend that forgets its dialect, or declares an intent it has not
implemented, fails here rather than at the user's first click.
