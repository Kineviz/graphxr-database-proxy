"""
A wheel built on this machine, offered to the installer like a published one.

The case these exist for is LatticeDB on Windows: the engine cross-compiles for it
in one command, and PyPI has nothing to install because the upstream CI has no
Windows job. Everything here is about that gap being closable by the user without
the proxy having to special-case a platform.
