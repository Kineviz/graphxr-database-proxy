"""
Private Network Access support.

GraphXR is usually served over HTTPS from a public origin while the proxy runs on
``http://localhost``. That combination is allowed (localhost is a
potentially-trustworthy origin, so it is not blocked as mixed content), but Chrome
additionally sends a **Private Network Access** preflight for any public -> local
request, carrying ``Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true``. A preflight
that comes back without ``Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true`` is rejected,
and the page sees an opaque ``TypeError: Failed to fetch``.

FastAPI's ``CORSMiddleware`` does not emit that header, so it is added here. The
long ``Access-Control-Max-Age`` matters too: every request carries ``X-API-Key``,
which makes it non-simple, so without caching the browser preflights each one.

See ai/graph-db-adapter-refactoring-spec.md section 8.5 in graphxr-dev.
