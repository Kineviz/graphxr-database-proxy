"""
A short-lived cache for ``/graphSchema``.

The API builds a fresh driver per request, so nothing carries a schema over from
an earlier call: every ``/graphSchema``, every ``/sampleData``, and every
``/expand`` against a primary-key backend re-probes the store from a cold
connection. The probe is not free on any backend -- Neo4j scans for its property
types, Spanner and BigQuery read ``INFORMATION_SCHEMA`` -- and the answer changes
about as often as someone alters a table.

Three properties this has to have, in the order they bite:

  - **Bounded staleness.** The default TTL is a minute. A schema change shows up
    on the next reload rather than after a restart, and nothing has to be
    invalidated by hand.
  - **A config edit takes effect at once.** The key carries a digest of the
    connection config, so re-pointing a project at another database misses the
    cache rather than serving the previous database's schema. The digest is of
    the config, never stored alongside it -- credentials do not enter the cache.
  - **One probe per miss, not one per caller.** GraphXR opens a graph by asking
    for the schema from several panels at once. Without a per-key lock, a cold
    cache turns that into simultaneous identical probes; the lock makes the
    others wait for the first.

Set ``GRAPH_SCHEMA_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=0`` to disable it entirely.
