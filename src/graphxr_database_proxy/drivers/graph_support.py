"""
Wires the shared intent machinery onto the concrete drivers.

A driver gets intent support by declaring two things — a capability record and a
dialect — and by being able to answer "what are this graph's categories and their
key types". Everything else comes from ``GraphIntentMixin``.

Kept in its own module so ``spanner.py`` and ``rocketgraph.py`` each gain a mixin
and a handful of properties rather than a copy of the traversal logic.
